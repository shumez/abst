<p><strong><a href="#" title="Mu-opioid receptors">Mu-opioid receptors (MORs)</a></strong> are the primary site of action of opioid drugs, both <a href="#" title="合法的な">licit</a> and <a href="#" title="非合法的な">illicit</a>. Susceptibility to opioid addiction is associated with variants in the gene encoding the MOR, <em><a href="#">OPRM1</a></em>. Varying with ethnicity, ∼25% of humans carry a single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) in <em>OPRM1</em> (A118G). This SNP produces a nonsynonymous amino acid substitution, replacing asparagine (N40) with aspartate (D40), and has been linked with an increased risk for drug addiction. While a murine model of human OPRM1 A118G (A112G in mouse) recapitulates most of the phenotypes reported in humans, the neuronal mechanisms underlying these phenotypes remain elusive. Here, we investigated the impact of A118G on opioid regulation of synaptic transmission in mesolimbic VTA dopaminergic neurons. Using electrophysiology, we showed that both inhibitory and excitatory inputs to VTA dopaminergic neurons projecting to the NAc medial shell were suppressed by the MOR agonists <a href="#">DAMGO</a> and morphine, which caused a shift in the excitatory/inhibitory balance and an increased action potential firing rate. Mice carrying the 112G/G allele exhibited lower sensitivity to DAMGO and morphine compared with major allele carriers (112A/A). Paradoxically, DAMGO produced facilitatory effects on <a href="#">mEPSCs</a>, which were mediated by presynaptic GABA<sub>B</sub> receptors. However, this was only prominent in homozygous major allele carriers, which could explain a stronger shift in action potential firing in 112A/A mice. This study provides a better understanding on the neurobiological mechanisms that may underlie risk of addiction development in carriers of the A118G SNP in OPRM1.</p>
<p><strong>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</strong> The pandemic of opioid drug abuse is associated with many socioeconomic burdens. The primary brain target of opioid drugs is the μ-opioid receptor (MOR), encoded by the OPRM1 gene, which is highly polymorphic in humans. Using a mouse model of the human OPRM1 A118G single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) (A112G in mice), we demonstrated that MOR and GABAB signaling coordinate in regulating mesolimbic dopamine neuronal firing via presynaptic regulation. The A118G SNP affects MOR-mediated suppression of GABA and glutamate release, showing weaker efficacy of synaptic regulation by MORs. These results may shed light on whether MOR SNPs need to be considered for devising effective therapeutic interventions.</p>
<h4 id="the_augmentation_of_retinogeniculate_communication_during_thalamic_burst_mode"><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/content/39/29/5697">The Augmentation of Retinogeniculate Communication during Thalamic Burst Mode</a><a class="headerlink" href="#the_augmentation_of_retinogeniculate_communication_during_thalamic_burst_mode" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h4>
<p>Retinal signals are transmitted to cortex via neurons in the lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN), where they are processed in burst or tonic response mode. Burst mode occurs when LGN neurons are sufficiently hyperpolarized for T-type Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels to deinactivate, allowing them to open in response to depolarization, which can trigger a high-frequency sequence of Na+-based spikes (i.e., burst). In contrast, T-type channels are inactivated during tonic mode and do not contribute to spiking. Although burst mode is commonly associated with sleep and the disruption of retinogeniculate communication, bursts can also be triggered by visual stimulation, thereby transforming the retinal signals relayed to the cortex. To determine how burst mode affects retinogeniculate communication, we made recordings from monosynaptically connected retinal ganglion cells and LGN neurons in male/female cats during visual stimulation. Our results reveal a robust augmentation of retinal signals within the LGN during burst mode. Specifically, retinal spikes were more effective and often triggered multiple LGN spikes during periods likely to have increased T-type Ca<sup>2+</sup> channel activity. Consistent with the biophysical properties of T-type Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels, analysis revealed that effect magnitude was correlated with the duration of the preceding thalamic interspike interval and occurred even in the absence of classically defined bursts. Importantly, the augmentation of geniculate responses to retinal input was not associated with a degradation of visual signals. Together, these results indicate a graded nature of response mode and suggest that, under certain conditions, bursts facilitate the transmission of visual information to the cortex by amplifying retinal signals.</p>
<p><strong>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</strong> The thalamus is the gateway for retinal information traveling to the cortex. The lateral geniculate nucleus, like all thalamic nuclei, has two classically defined categories of spikes—tonic and burst—that differ in their underlying cellular mechanisms. Here we compare retinogeniculate communication during burst and tonic response modes. Our results show that retinogeniculate communication is enhanced during burst mode and visually evoked thalamic bursts, thereby augmenting retinal signals transmitted to cortex. Further, our results demonstrate that the influence of burst mode on retinogeniculate communication is graded and can be measured even in the absence of classically defined thalamic bursts.</p>

<p>Central alexia (CA) is an acquired reading disorder co-occurring with a generalized language deficit (aphasia). The roles of perilesional and ipsilesional tissue in recovery from poststroke aphasia are unclear. We investigated the impact of reading training (using iReadMore, a therapy app) on the connections within and between the right and left hemisphere of the reading network of patients with CA. In patients with pure alexia, iReadMore increased feedback from left inferior frontal gyrus (IFG) region to the left occipital (OCC) region. We aimed to identify whether iReadMore therapy was effective through a similar mechanism in patients with CA. Participants with chronic poststroke CA (n = 23) completed 35 h of iReadMore training over 4 weeks. Reading accuracy for trained and untrained words was assessed before and after therapy. The neural response to reading trained and untrained words in the left and right OCC, ventral occipitotemporal, and IFG regions was examined using event-related magnetoencephalography. The training-related modulation in effective connectivity between regions was modeled at the group level with dynamic causal modeling. iReadMore training improved participants' reading accuracy by an average of 8.4% (range, −2.77 to 31.66) while accuracy for untrained words was stable. Training increased regional sensitivity in bilateral frontal and occipital regions, and strengthened feedforward connections within the left hemisphere. Our data suggest that iReadMore training in these patients modulates lower-order visual representations, as opposed to higher-order, more abstract representations, to improve word-reading accuracy.</p>
<p><strong>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</strong> This is the first study to conduct a network-level analysis of therapy effects in participants with poststroke central alexia. When patients trained with iReadMore (a multimodal, behavioral, mass practice, computer-based therapy), reading accuracy improved by an average 8.4% on trained items. A network analysis of the magnetoencephalography data associated with this improvement revealed an increase in regional sensitivity in bilateral frontal and occipital regions and strengthening of feedforward connections within the left hemisphere. This indicates that in patients with CA iReadMore engages lower-order, intact resources within the left hemisphere (posterior to their lesion locations) to improve word reading. This provides a foundation for future research to investigate reading network modulation in different CA subtypes, or for sentence-level therapy.</p>

<p>Contextual fear memory becomes less context-specific over time, a phenomenon referred to as <strong>contextual fear generalization</strong>. Overgeneralization of contextual fear memory is a core symptom of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), but circuit mechanisms underlying the generalization remain unclear. We show here that neural projections from the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) to ventral hippocampus (vHPC) mediate contextual fear generalization in male mice. Retrieval of contextual fear in a novel context at a remote time point activated cells in the ACC and vHPC, as indicated by significantly increased C-fos+ cells. Using chemogenetic or photogenetic manipulations, we observed that silencing the activity of ACC or vHPC neurons reduced contextual fear generalization at the remote time point, whereas stimulating the activity of ACC or vHPC neurons facilitated contextual fear generalization at a recent time point. We found that ACC neurons projected to the vHPC unidirectionally, and importantly, silencing the activity of projection fibers from the ACC to vHPC inhibited contextual fear generalization at the remote time point. Together, our findings reveal an ACC to vHPC circuit that controls expression of fear generalization and may offer new strategies to prevent or reverse contextual fear generalization in subjects with anxiety disorders, especially in PTSD.</p>
<p><strong>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</strong> Overgeneralization of contextual fear memory is a cardinal feature of PTSD, but circuit mechanisms underlying it remain unclear. Our study indicates that neural projections from the anterior cingulate cortex to ventral hippocampus control the expression of contextual fear generalization. Thus, manipulating the circuit may prevent or reverse fear overgeneralization in subjects with PTSD.</p>
<h4 id="regional_striatal_cholinergic_involvement_in_human_behavioral_flexibility"><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/content/39/29/5740">Regional Striatal Cholinergic Involvement in Human Behavioral Flexibility</a><a class="headerlink" href="#regional_striatal_cholinergic_involvement_in_human_behavioral_flexibility" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h4>
<p>Animal studies have shown that the striatal cholinergic system plays a role in behavioral flexibility but, until recently, this system could not be studied in humans due to a lack of appropriate noninvasive techniques. Using proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy, we recently showed that the concentration of dorsal striatal choline (an acetylcholine precursor) changes during reversal learning (a measure of behavioral flexibility) in humans. The aim of the present study was to examine whether regional average striatal choline was associated with reversal learning. A total of 22 participants (mean age = 25.2 years, range = 18–32 years, 13 female) reached learning criterion in a probabilistic learning task with a reversal component. We measured choline at rest in both the dorsal and ventral striatum using magnetic resonance spectroscopy. Task performance was described using a simple reinforcement learning model that dissociates the contributions of positive and negative prediction errors to learning. Average levels of choline in the dorsal striatum were associated with performance during reversal, but not during initial learning. Specifically, lower levels of choline in the dorsal striatum were associated with a lower number of perseverative trials. Moreover, choline levels explained interindividual variance in perseveration over and above that explained by learning from negative prediction errors. These findings suggest that the dorsal striatal cholinergic system plays an important role in behavioral flexibility, in line with evidence from the animal literature and our previous work in humans. Additionally, this work provides further support for the idea of measuring choline with magnetic resonance spectroscopy as a noninvasive way of studying human cholinergic neurochemistry.</p>
<p><strong>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</strong> Behavioral flexibility is a crucial component of adaptation and survival. Evidence from the animal literature shows that the striatal cholinergic system is fundamental to reversal learning, a key paradigm for studying behavioral flexibility, but this system remains understudied in humans. Using proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy, we showed that choline levels at rest in the dorsal striatum are associated with performance specifically during reversal learning. These novel findings help to bridge the gap between animal and human studies by demonstrating the importance of cholinergic function in the dorsal striatum in human behavioral flexibility. Importantly, the methods described here cannot only be applied to furthering our understanding of healthy human neurochemistry, but also to extending our understanding of cholinergic disorders.</p>

<p>Humans excel at understanding speech even in adverse conditions such as background noise. Speech processing may be aided by cortical activity in the delta and theta frequency bands, which have been found to track the speech envelope. However, the rhythm of non-speech sounds is tracked by cortical activity as well. It therefore remains unclear which aspects of neural speech tracking represent the processing of acoustic features, related to the clarity of speech, and which aspects reflect higher-level linguistic processing related to speech comprehension. Here we <a href="#" title="違いを明確にする">disambiguate</a> the roles of cortical tracking for speech clarity and comprehension through recording EEG responses to native and foreign language in different levels of background noise, for which clarity and comprehension vary independently. We then use a both a decoding and an encoding approach to relate clarity and comprehension to the neural responses. We find that cortical tracking in the theta frequency band is mainly correlated to clarity, whereas the delta band contributes most to speech comprehension. Moreover, we uncover an early neural component in the delta band that informs on comprehension and that may reflect a predictive mechanism for language processing. Our results disentangle the functional contributions of cortical speech tracking in the delta and theta bands to speech processing. They also show that both speech clarity and comprehension can be accurately decoded from relatively short segments of EEG recordings, which may have applications in future mind-controlled auditory prosthesis.</p>
<p><strong>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</strong> Speech is a highly complex signal whose processing requires analysis from lower-level acoustic features to higher-level linguistic information. Recent work has shown that neural activity in the delta and theta frequency bands track the rhythm of speech, but the role of this tracking for speech processing remains unclear. Here we disentangle the roles of cortical entrainment in different frequency bands and at different temporal lags for speech clarity, reflecting the acoustics of the signal, and speech comprehension, related to linguistic processing. We show that cortical speech tracking in the theta frequency band encodes mostly speech clarity, and thus acoustic aspects of the signal, whereas speech tracking in the delta band encodes the higher-level speech comprehension.</p>
