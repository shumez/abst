The patients showed normal electroretinography responses, no signs of albinism, and no anterior segment or brain abnormalities. Upon whole exome sequencing, we identified a homozygous mutation (c.1861C>T;p.Q621*) in the aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AHR) gene that perfectly co-segregated with the disease in the larger family. AHR is a ligand-activated transcription factor that has been intensively studied in xenobiotic-induced toxicity. Further, it has been shown to play a physiological role under normal cellular conditions, such as in immunity, inflammatory response and neurogenesis. Notably, knockout of the Ahr gene in mouse impairs optic nerve myelin sheath formation and results in oculomotor deficits sharing many features with our patients: the eye movement disorder in Ahr\u2212/\u2212 mice appears early in development and presents as conjugate horizontal pendular nystagmus. We therefore propose AHR to be a novel disease gene for a new, recessively inherited disorder in humans, characterized by infantile nystagmus and foveal hypoplasia. Loss of STEP61 couples disinhibition to N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor potentiation in rodent and human spinal pain processing \u00b6 Dysregulated excitability within the spinal dorsal horn is a critical mediator of chronic pain. In the rodent nerve injury model of neuropathic pain, BDNF-mediated loss of inhibition (disinhibition) gates the potentiation of excitatory GluN2B N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor (NMDAR) responses at lamina I dorsal horn synapses. However, the centrality of this mechanism across pain states and species, as well as the molecular linker involved, remain unknown. Here, we show that KCC2-dependent disinhibition is coupled to increased GluN2B-mediated synaptic NMDAR responses in a rodent model of inflammatory pain, with an associated downregulation of the tyrosine phosphatase STEP61. The decreased activity of STEP61 is both necessary and sufficient to prime subsequent phosphorylation and potentiation of GluN2B NMDAR by BDNF at lamina I synapses. Blocking disinhibition reversed the downregulation of STEP61 as well as inflammation-mediated behavioural hypersensitivity. For the first time, we characterize GluN2B-mediated NMDAR responses at human lamina I synapses and show that a human ex vivo BDNF model of pathological pain processing downregulates KCC2 and STEP61 and upregulates phosphorylated GluN2B at dorsal horn synapses. Our results demonstrate that STEP61 is the molecular brake that is lost following KCC2-dependent disinhibition and that the decrease in STEP61 activity drives the potentiation of excitatory GluN2B NMDAR responses in rodent and human models of pathological pain. The ex vivo human BDNF model may thus form a translational bridge between rodents and humans for identification and validation of novel molecular pain targets.

Human Brain \u00b6 Abstract offered val (rTPJ, ldlPFC) effective val (rAI) decision val (mPFC) Social signals play powerful roles in shaping self-oriented reward valuation and decision making. These signals activate social and valuation/decision areas, but the core computation for their integration into the self-oriented decision machinery remains unclear. Here, we study how a fundamental social signal, social value (others' reward value), is converted into self-oriented decision making in the human brain. Using behavioral analysis, modeling, and neuroimaging, we show three-stage processing of social value conversion from the offer to the effective value and then to the final decision value. First, a value of others' bonus on offer, called offered value , was encoded uniquely in the right temporoparietal junction ( rTPJ ) and also in the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex ( ldlPFC ), which is commonly activated by offered self-bonus value. The effective value , an intermediate value representing the effective influence of the offer on the decision, was represented in the right anterior insula ( rAI ), and the final decision value was encoded in the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC). Second, using psychophysiological interaction and dynamic causal modeling analyses, we demonstrated three-stage feedforward processing from the rTPJ and ldPFC to the rAI and then from rAI to the mPFC. Further, we showed that these characteristics of social conversion underlie distinct sociobehavioral phenotypes. We demonstrate that the variability in the conversion underlies the difference between prosocial and selfish subjects, as seen from the differential strength of the rAI and ldlPFC coupling to the mPFC responses, respectively. Together, these findings identified fundamental neural computation processes for social value conversion underlying complex social decision making behaviors. SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT In daily life, we make decisions based on self-interest, but also in consideration for others' status. These social influences modulate valuation and decision signals in the brain, suggesting a fundamental process called value conversion that translates social information into self-referenced decisions. However, little is known about the conversion process and its underlying brain mechanisms. We investigated value conversion using human fMRI with computational modeling and found three essential stages in a progressive brain circuit from social to empathic and decision areas. Interestingly, the brain mechanism of conversion differed between prosocial and individualistic subjects. These findings reveal how the brain processes and merges social information into the elemental flow of self-interested decision making. NMDA Receptor-Dependent Dynamics of Hippocampal Place Cell Ensembles \u00b6 Competitive Frontoparietal Interactions Mediate Implicit Inferences \u00b6 Abstract Frequent experience with regularities in our environment allows us to use predictive information to guide our decision process. However, contingencies in our environment are not always explicitly present and sometimes need to be inferred. Heretofore, it remained unknown how predictive information guides decision-making when explicit knowledge is absent and how the brain shapes such implicit inferences. In the present experiment, 17 human participants (9 females) performed a discrimination task in which a target stimulus was preceded by a predictive cue. Critically, participants had no explicit knowledge that some of the cues signaled an upcoming target, allowing us to investigate how implicit inferences emerge and guide decision-making. Despite unawareness of the cue\u2013target contingencies, participants were able to use implicit information to improve performance. Concurrent EEG recordings demonstrate that implicit inferences rely upon interactions between internally and externally oriented networks, whereby prefrontal regions inhibit parietal cortex under internal implicit control. SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT Regularities in our environment can guide our behavior providing information about upcoming events. Interestingly, such predictive information does not need to be explicitly represented to effectively guide our decision process. Here, we show how the brain engages in such real-world \u201cdata mining\u201d and how implicit inferences emerge. We used a contingency cueing task and demonstrated that implicit inferences influenced responses to subsequent targets despite a lack of awareness of cue\u2013target contingencies. Further, we show that these implicit inferences emerge through interactions between internally and externally oriented neural networks. The current results highlight the importance of prefrontal processes in transforming external events into predictive internalized models of the world. Salience-Driven Value Construction for Adaptive Choice under Risk \u00b6 Decisions we face in real life are inherently risky and can result in one of many possible outcomes. However, most of what we know about choice under risk is based on studies that use options with only two possible outcomes (simple gambles), so it remains unclear how the brain constructs reward values for more complex risky options faced in real life. To address this question, we combined experimental and modeling approaches to examine choice between pairs of simple gambles and pairs of three-outcome gambles in male and female human subjects. We found that subjects evaluated individual outcomes of three-outcome gambles by multiplying functions of reward magnitude and probability. To construct the overall value of each gamble, however, most subjects differentially weighted possible outcomes based on either reward magnitude or probability. These results reveal a novel dissociation between how reward information is processed when evaluating complex gambles: valuation of each outcome is based on a combination of reward information whereas weighting of possible outcomes mainly relies on a single piece of reward information. We show that differential weighting of possible outcomes could enable subjects to make decisions more easily and quickly. Together, our findings reveal a plausible mechanism for how salience, in terms of possible reward magnitude or probability, can influence the construction of subjective values for complex gambles. They also point to separable neural mechanisms for how reward value controls choice and attention to allow for more adaptive decision making under risk. SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT Real-life decisions are inherently risky and can result in one of many possible outcomes, but how does the brain integrate information from all these outcomes to make decisions? To address this question, we examined choice between pairs of gambles with multiple outcomes using various computational models. We found that subjects evaluated individual outcomes by multiplying functions of reward magnitude and probability. To construct the overall value of each gamble, however, they differentially weighted possible outcomes based on either reward magnitude or probability. By doing so, they were able to make decisions more easily and quickly.

These signals activate social and valuation/decision areas, but the core computation for their integration into the self-oriented decision machinery remains unclear. Here, we study how a fundamental social signal, social value (others' reward value), is converted into self-oriented decision making in the human brain. Using behavioral analysis, modeling, and neuroimaging, we show three-stage processing of social value conversion from the offer to the effective value and then to the final decision value. First, a value of others' bonus on offer, called offered value , was encoded uniquely in the right temporoparietal junction ( rTPJ ) and also in the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex ( ldlPFC ), which is commonly activated by offered self-bonus value. The effective value , an intermediate value representing the effective influence of the offer on the decision, was represented in the right anterior insula ( rAI ), and the final decision value was encoded in the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC). Second, using psychophysiological interaction and dynamic causal modeling analyses, we demonstrated three-stage feedforward processing from the rTPJ and ldPFC to the rAI and then from rAI to the mPFC. Further, we showed that these characteristics of social conversion underlie distinct sociobehavioral phenotypes. We demonstrate that the variability in the conversion underlies the difference between prosocial and selfish subjects, as seen from the differential strength of the rAI and ldlPFC coupling to the mPFC responses, respectively. Together, these findings identified fundamental neural computation processes for social value conversion underlying complex social decision making behaviors. SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT In daily life, we make decisions based on self-interest, but also in consideration for others' status. These social influences modulate valuation and decision signals in the brain, suggesting a fundamental process called value conversion that translates social information into self-referenced decisions. However, little is known about the conversion process and its underlying brain mechanisms. We investigated value conversion using human fMRI with computational modeling and found three essential stages in a progressive brain circuit from social to empathic and decision areas. Interestingly, the brain mechanism of conversion differed between prosocial and individualistic subjects. These findings reveal how the brain processes and merges social information into the elemental flow of self-interested decision making.","title":"Computing Social Value Conversion in the Human Brain"},{"location":"JNeurosci/2019-06-26/#nmda_receptor-dependent_dynamics_of_hippocampal_place_cell_ensembles","text":"","title":"NMDA Receptor-Dependent Dynamics of Hippocampal Place Cell Ensembles"},{"location":"JNeurosci/2019-06-26/#competitive_frontoparietal_interactions_mediate_implicit_inferences","text":"Abstract Frequent experience with regularities in our environment allows us to use predictive information to guide our decision process. However, contingencies in our environment are not always explicitly present and sometimes need to be inferred. Heretofore, it remained unknown how predictive information guides decision-making when explicit knowledge is absent and how the brain shapes such implicit inferences. In the present experiment, 17 human participants (9 females) performed a discrimination task in which a target stimulus was preceded by a predictive cue. Critically, participants had no explicit knowledge that some of the cues signaled an upcoming target, allowing us to investigate how implicit inferences emerge and guide decision-making. Despite unawareness of the cue\u2013target contingencies, participants were able to use implicit information to improve performance. Concurrent EEG recordings demonstrate that implicit inferences rely upon interactions between internally and externally oriented networks, whereby prefrontal regions inhibit parietal cortex under internal implicit control. SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT Regularities in our environment can guide our behavior providing information about upcoming events. Interestingly, such predictive information does not need to be explicitly represented to effectively guide our decision process. Here, we show how the brain engages in such real-world \u201cdata mining\u201d and how implicit inferences emerge. We used a contingency cueing task and demonstrated that implicit inferences influenced responses to subsequent targets despite a lack of awareness of cue\u2013target contingencies.

However, most of what we know about choice under risk is based on studies that use options with only two possible outcomes (simple gambles), so it remains unclear how the brain constructs reward values for more complex risky options faced in real life. To address this question, we combined experimental and modeling approaches to examine choice between pairs of simple gambles and pairs of three-outcome gambles in male and female human subjects. We found that subjects evaluated individual outcomes of three-outcome gambles by multiplying functions of reward magnitude and probability. To construct the overall value of each gamble, however, most subjects differentially weighted possible outcomes based on either reward magnitude or probability. These results reveal a novel dissociation between how reward information is processed when evaluating complex gambles: valuation of each outcome is based on a combination of reward information whereas weighting of possible outcomes mainly relies on a single piece of reward information. We show that differential weighting of possible outcomes could enable subjects to make decisions more easily and quickly. Together, our findings reveal a plausible mechanism for how salience, in terms of possible reward magnitude or probability, can influence the construction of subjective values for complex gambles. They also point to separable neural mechanisms for how reward value controls choice and attention to allow for more adaptive decision making under risk.

Using this tool, pericyte loss in the adult brain is shown to induce neuronal loss due to concurrent microcirculatory failure and depletion of the protective trophic factor pleiotrophin. A traffic jam leads to Lewy bodies \u00b6 Shahmoradian and colleagues report that the structure of Lewy bodies in Parkinson\u2019s disease consists of \u03b1-synuclein and lipid vesicle clusters instead of the long-assumed amyloid fibril core. This finding has implications for our understanding of the underlying pathogenesis of synucleinopathies. Brief Communications \u00b6 Central nervous system regeneration is driven by microglia necroptosis and repopulation \u00b6 Morphine withdrawal recruits lateral habenula cytokine signaling to reduce synaptic excitation and sociability \u00b6 Divergence in the functional organization of human and macaque auditory cortex revealed by fMRI responses to harmonic tones \u00b6 We report a difference between humans and macaque monkeys in the functional organization of cortical regions implicated in pitch perception. Humans but not macaques showed regions with a strong preference for harmonic sounds compared to noise , measured with both synthetic tones and macaque vocalizations. In contrast, frequency-selective tonotopic maps were similar between the two species. This species difference may be driven by the unique demands of speech and music perception in humans. Thermal constraints on in vivo optogenetic manipulations \u00b6 Articles \u00b6 Genome-wide association study implicates CHRNA2 in cannabis use disorder \u00b6 Cannabis is the most frequently used illicit psychoactive substance worldwide; around one in ten users become dependent. The risk for cannabis use disorder (CUD) has a strong genetic component, with twin heritability estimates ranging from 51 to 70%. Here we performed a genome-wide association study of CUD in 2,387 cases and 48,985 controls, followed by replication in 5,501 cases and 301,041 controls. We report a genome-wide significant risk locus for CUD ( P\u2009=\u20099.31\u2009\u00d7\u200910^{\u221212} ) that replicates in an independent population ( P_{\\text{replication}}\u2009=\u20093.27\u2009\u00d7\u200910^{\u22123} , P_{\\text{meta-analysis}}\u2009=\u20099.09\u2009\u00d7\u200910^{\u221212} ). The index variant (rs56372821) is a strong expression quantitative trait locus for cholinergic receptor nicotinic \u03b12 subunit (CHRNA2) ; analyses of the genetically regulated gene expression identified a significant association of CHRNA2 expression with CUD in brain tissue. At the polygenic level, analyses revealed a significant decrease in the risk of CUD with increased load of variants associated with cognitive performance. The results provide biological insights and inform on the genetic architecture of CUD. Sensory lesioning induces microglial synapse elimination via ADAM10 and fractalkine signaling \u00b6 Microglia rapidly respond to changes in neural activity and inflammation to regulate synaptic connectivity. The extracellular signals, particularly neuron-derived molecules, that drive these microglial functions at synapses remain a key open question. Here we show that whisker lesioning, known to dampen cortical activity, induces microglia-mediated synapse elimination. This synapse elimination is dependent on signaling by [CX3CR1] , the receptor for microglial fractalkine (also known as [CXCL1] ), but not complement receptor 3. Furthermore, mice deficient in CX3CL1 have profound defects in synapse elimination. Single-cell RNA sequencing revealed that Cx3cl1 is derived from cortical neurons, and ADAM10, a metalloprotease that cleaves CX3CL1 into a secreted form, is upregulated specifically in layer IV neurons and in microglia following whisker lesioning. Finally, inhibition of ADAM10 phenocopies Cx3cr1 \u2212/\u2212 and Cx3cl1 \u2212/\u2212 synapse elimination defects. Together, these results identify neuron-to-microglia signaling necessary for cortical synaptic remodeling and reveal that context-dependent immune mechanisms are utilized to remodel synapses in the mammalian brain. Pericyte loss leads to circulatory failure and pleiotrophin depletion causing neuron loss \u00b6 Pericytes are positioned between brain capillary endothelial cells, astrocytes and neurons. They degenerate in multiple neurological disorders. However, their role in the pathogenesis of these disorders remains debatable. Here we generate an inducible pericyte-specific Cre line and cross pericyte-specific Cre mice with iDTR mice carrying Cre-dependent human diphtheria toxin receptor . After pericyte ablation with diphtheria toxin, mice showed acute blood\u2013brain barrier breakdown, severe loss of blood flow, and a rapid neuron loss that was associated with loss of pericyte-derived pleiotrophin (PTN) , a neurotrophic growth factor. Intracerebroventricular PTN infusions prevented neuron loss in pericyte-ablated mice despite persistent circulatory changes. Silencing of pericyte-derived Ptn rendered neurons vulnerable to ischemic and excitotoxic injury. Our data demonstrate a rapid neurodegeneration cascade that links pericyte loss to acute circulatory collapse and loss of PTN neurotrophic support . These findings may have implications for the pathogenesis and treatment of neurological disorders that are associated with pericyte loss and/or neurovascular dysfunction. Lewy pathology in Parkinson\u2019s disease consists of crowded organelles and lipid membranes \u00b6 Parkinson\u2019s disease, the most common age-related movement disorder, is a progressive neurodegenerative disease with unclear etiology. Key neuropathological hallmarks are Lewy bodies and Lewy neurites: neuronal inclusions immunopositive for the protein \u03b1-synuclein. In-depth ultrastructural analysis of Lewy pathology is crucial to understanding pathogenesis of this disease. Using correlative light and electron microscopy and tomography on postmortem human brain tissue from Parkinson\u2019s disease brain donors, we identified \u03b1-synuclein immunopositive Lewy pathology and show a crowded environment of membranes [therein], including vesicular structures and dysmorphic organelles. Filaments interspersed between the membranes and organelles were identifiable in many but not all \u03b1-synuclein inclusions. Crowding of organellar components was confirmed by stimulated emission depletion (STED)-based super-resolution microscopy, and high lipid content within \u03b1-synuclein immunopositive inclusions was corroborated by confocal imaging, Fourier-transform coherent anti-Stokes Raman scattering infrared imaging and lipidomics. Applying such correlative high-resolution imaging and biophysical approaches, we discovered an aggregated protein\u2013lipid compartmentalization not previously described in the Parkinsons\u2019 disease brain. Single-cell activity tracking reveals that orbitofrontal neurons acquire and maintain a long-term memory to guide behavioral adaptation \u00b6 Learning to predict rewards based on environmental cues is essential for survival. The orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) contributes to such learning by conveying reward-related information to brain areas such as the ventral tegmental area (VTA). Despite this, how cue\u2013reward memory representations form in individual OFC neurons and are modified based on new information is unknown. To address this, using in vivo two-photon calcium imaging in mice, we tracked the response evolution of thousands of OFC output neurons, including those projecting to VTA, through multiple days and stages of cue\u2013reward learning. Collectively, we show that OFC contains several functional clusters of neurons distinctly encoding cue\u2013reward memory representations, with only select responses routed downstream to VTA. Unexpectedly, these representations were stably maintained by the same neurons even after extinction of the cue\u2013reward pairing, and supported behavioral learning and memory. Thus, OFC neuronal activity represents a long-term cue\u2013reward associative memory to support behavioral adaptation. Emergent modular neural control drives coordinated motor actions \u00b6 A remarkable feature of motor control is the ability to coordinate movements across distinct body parts into a consistent, skilled action. To reach and grasp an object, \u2018gross\u2019 arm and \u2018fine\u2019 dexterous movements must be coordinated as a single action. How the nervous system achieves this coordination is currently unknown. One possibility is that, with training, gross and fine movements are co-optimized to produce a coordinated action; alternatively, gross and fine movements may be modularly refined to function together. To address this question, we recorded neural activity in the primary motor cortex and dorsolateral striatum during reach-to-grasp skill learning in rats. During learning, the refinement of fine and gross movements was behaviorally and neurally dissociable. Furthermore, inactivation of the primary motor cortex and dorsolateral striatum had distinct effects on skilled fine and gross movements. Our results indicate that skilled movement coordination is achieved through emergent modular neural control. State-dependent decoupling of sensory and motor circuits underlies behavioral flexibility in Drosophila \u00b6 An approaching predator and self-motion toward an object can generate similar looming patterns on the retina, but these situations demand different rapid responses. How central circuits flexibly process visual cues to activate appropriate, fast motor pathways remains unclear. Here we identify two descending neuron (DN) types that control landing and contribute to visuomotor flexibility in Drosophila . For each, silencing impairs visually evoked landing, activation drives landing, and spike rate determines leg extension amplitude. Critically, visual responses of both DNs are severely attenuated during non-flight periods, effectively decoupling visual stimuli from the landing motor pathway when landing is inappropriate. The flight-dependence mechanism differs between DN types. Octopamine exposure mimics flight effects in one, whereas the other probably receives neuronal feedback from flight motor circuits. Thus, this sensorimotor flexibility arises from distinct mechanisms for gating action-specific descending pathways, such that sensory and motor networks are coupled or decoupled according to the behavioral state. An amplitude code transmits information at a visual synapse \u00b6 Most neurons transmit information digitally using spikes that trigger the release of synaptic vesicles with low probability. The first stages of vision and hearing are distinct in that they operate with analog signals, but it is unclear how these are recoded for synaptic transmission. By imaging the release of glutamate in live zebrafish, we demonstrate that ribbon synapses of retinal bipolar cells encode contrast through changes in both the frequency and amplitude of release events. Higher contrasts caused multiple vesicles to be released within an event, and such coding by amplitude often continued after the rate code had reached a maximum frequency. Glutamate packets equivalent to five vesicles transmitted four times as many bits of information per vesicle compared with those released individually. By discretizing analog signals into sequences of numbers up to about 11, ribbon synapses can increase the dynamic range, temporal precision and efficiency with which visual information is transmitted. High-order coordination of cortical spiking activity modulates perceptual accuracy \u00b6 whether and how temporally precise neuronal coordination in population activity influences perception The accurate relay of electrical signals within cortical networks is key to perception and cognitive function. Theoretically, it has long been proposed that temporal coordination of neuronal spiking activity controls signal transmission and behavior. However, whether and how temporally precise neuronal coordination in population activity influences perception are unknown. Here, we recorded populations of neurons in early and mid-level visual cortex (areas V1 and V4) simultaneously to discover that the precise temporal coordination between the spiking activity of three or more cells carries information about visual perception in the absence of firing rate modulation. The accuracy of perceptual responses correlated with high-order spiking coordination within V4, but not V1, and with feedforward coordination between V1 and V4. These results indicate that while visual stimuli are encoded in the discharge rates of neurons, perceptual accuracy is related to temporally precise spiking coordination within and between cortical networks. Circuit mechanisms for the maintenance and manipulation of information in working memory \u00b6 biorxiv Recently it has been proposed that information in working memory (WM) may not always be stored in persistent neuronal activity but can be maintained in \u2018[activity-silent]\u2019 hidden states, such as synaptic efficacies endowed with short-term synaptic plasticity . To test this idea computationally, we investigated recurrent neural network models trained to perform several WM-dependent tasks, in which WM representation emerges from learning and is not a priori assumed to depend on self-sustained persistent activity. We found that short-term synaptic plasticity can support the short-term maintenance of information, provided that the memory delay period is sufficiently short. However, in tasks that require actively manipulating information, persistent activity naturally emerges from learning, and the amount of persistent activity scales with the degree of manipulation required. These results shed insight into the current debate on WM encoding and suggest that persistent activity can vary markedly between short-term memory tasks with different cognitive demands. Understanding LSTMs A diversity of interneurons and Hebbian plasticity facilitate rapid compressible learning in the hippocampus \u00b6 The hippocampus is able to rapidly learn incoming information, even if that information is only observed once. Furthermore, this information can be replayed in a compressed format in either forward or reverse modes during sharp wave\u2013ripples (SPW\u2013Rs). We leveraged state-of-the-art techniques in training recurrent spiking networks to demonstrate how primarily interneuron networks can achieve the following: (1) generate internal theta sequences to bind externally elicited spikes in the presence of inhibition from the medial septum; (2) compress learned spike sequences in the form of a SPW\u2013R when septal inhibition is removed; (3) generate and refine high-frequency assemblies during SPW\u2013R-mediated compression; and (4) regulate the inter-SPW interval timing between SPW\u2013Rs in ripple clusters. From the fast timescale of neurons to the slow timescale of behaviors, interneuron networks serve as the scaffolding for one-shot learning by replaying, reversing, refining, and regulating spike sequences. Resources \u00b6 Classification of electrophysiological and morphological neuron types in the mouse visual cortex \u00b6 Understanding the diversity of cell types in the brain has been an enduring challenge and requires detailed characterization of individual neurons in multiple dimensions. To systematically profile morpho-electric properties of mammalian neurons, we established a single-cell characterization pipeline using standardized patch-clamp recordings in brain slices and biocytin-based neuronal reconstructions. We built a publicly accessible online database, the Allen Cell Types Database, to display these datasets. Intrinsic physiological properties were measured from 1,938 neurons from the adult laboratory mouse visual cortex, morphological properties were measured from 461 reconstructed neurons, and 452 neurons had both measurements available. Quantitative features were used to classify neurons into distinct types using unsupervised methods. We established a taxonomy of morphologically and electrophysiologically defined cell types for this region of the cortex, with 17 electrophysiological types, 38 morphological types and 46 morpho-electric types. There was good correspondence with previously defined transcriptomic cell types and subclasses using the same transgenic mouse lines.

The extracellular signals, particularly neuron-derived molecules, that drive these microglial functions at synapses remain a key open question.

This synapse elimination is dependent on signaling by [CX3CR1] , the receptor for microglial fractalkine (also known as [CXCL1] ), but not complement receptor 3. Furthermore, mice deficient in CX3CL1 have profound defects in synapse elimination. Single-cell RNA sequencing revealed that Cx3cl1 is derived from cortical neurons, and ADAM10, a metalloprotease that cleaves CX3CL1 into a secreted form, is upregulated specifically in layer IV neurons and in microglia following whisker lesioning. Finally, inhibition of ADAM10 phenocopies Cx3cr1 \u2212/\u2212 and Cx3cl1 \u2212/\u2212 synapse elimination defects.

To address this, using in vivo two-photon calcium imaging in mice, we tracked the response evolution of thousands of OFC output neurons, including those projecting to VTA, through multiple days and stages of cue\u2013reward learning. Collectively, we show that OFC contains several functional clusters of neurons distinctly encoding cue\u2013reward memory representations, with only select responses routed downstream to VTA.

How the nervous system achieves this coordination is currently unknown. One possibility is that, with training, gross and fine movements are co-optimized to produce a coordinated action; alternatively, gross and fine movements may be modularly refined to function together. To address this question, we recorded neural activity in the primary motor cortex and dorsolateral striatum during reach-to-grasp skill learning in rats. During learning, the refinement of fine and gross movements was behaviorally and neurally dissociable. Furthermore, inactivation of the primary motor cortex and dorsolateral striatum had distinct effects on skilled fine and gross movements.

How central circuits flexibly process visual cues to activate appropriate, fast motor pathways remains unclear. Here we identify two descending neuron (DN) types that control landing and contribute to visuomotor flexibility in Drosophila . For each, silencing impairs visually evoked landing, activation drives landing, and spike rate determines leg extension amplitude. Critically, visual responses of both DNs are severely attenuated during non-flight periods, effectively decoupling visual stimuli from the landing motor pathway when landing is inappropriate. The flight-dependence mechanism differs between DN types. Octopamine exposure mimics flight effects in one, whereas the other probably receives neuronal feedback from flight motor circuits. Thus, this sensorimotor flexibility arises from distinct mechanisms for gating action-specific descending pathways, such that sensory and motor networks are coupled or decoupled according to the behavioral state.","title":"State-dependent decoupling of sensory and motor circuits underlies behavioral flexibility in Drosophila"},{"location":"NatNeurosci/2019-07/#an_amplitude_code_transmits_information_at_a_visual_synapse","text":"Most neurons transmit information digitally using spikes that trigger the release of synaptic vesicles with low probability. The first stages of vision and hearing are distinct in that they operate with analog signals, but it is unclear how these are recoded for synaptic transmission. By imaging the release of glutamate in live zebrafish, we demonstrate that ribbon synapses of retinal bipolar cells encode contrast through changes in both the frequency and amplitude of release events. Higher contrasts caused multiple vesicles to be released within an event, and such coding by amplitude often continued after the rate code had reached a maximum frequency. Glutamate packets equivalent to five vesicles transmitted four times as many bits of information per vesicle compared with those released individually.

Here, we recorded populations of neurons in early and mid-level visual cortex (areas V1 and V4) simultaneously to discover that the precise temporal coordination between the spiking activity of three or more cells carries information about visual perception in the absence of firing rate modulation. The accuracy of perceptual responses correlated with high-order spiking coordination within V4, but not V1, and with feedforward coordination between V1 and V4.

We found that short-term synaptic plasticity can support the short-term maintenance of information, provided that the memory delay period is sufficiently short. However, in tasks that require actively manipulating information, persistent activity naturally emerges from learning, and the amount of persistent activity scales with the degree of manipulation required. These results shed insight into the current debate on WM encoding and suggest that persistent activity can vary markedly between short-term memory tasks with different cognitive demands.

Several families of proteins have well-established roles in guiding developing spinal cord axons, and recent findings have identified new axon guidance molecules. Nevertheless, an integrated view of spinal cord network development is lacking, and many current models have neglected the cellular and functional diversity of spinal cord circuits. Recent advances challenge the existing spinal cord axon guidance dogmas and have provided a more complex, but more faithful, picture of the ontogenesis of vertebrate spinal cord circuits. Embracing diversity in the 5-HT neuronal system \u00b6 Neurons that synthesize and release 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT; serotonin) express a core set of genes that establish and maintain this neurotransmitter phenotype and distinguish these neurons from other brain cells. Beyond a shared 5-HTergic phenotype, these neurons display divergent cellular properties in relation to anatomy, morphology, hodology, electrophysiology and gene expression, including differential expression of molecules supporting co-transmission of additional neurotransmitters. This diversity suggests that functionally heterogeneous subtypes of 5-HT neurons exist, but linking subsets of these neurons to particular functions has been technically challenging. We discuss recent data from molecular genetic, genomic and functional methods that, when coupled with classical findings, yield a reframing of the 5-HT neuronal system as a conglomeration of diverse subsystems with potential to inspire novel, more targeted therapies for clinically distinct 5-HT-related disorders. Perspectives \u00b6 Understanding rostral\u2013caudal auditory cortex contributions to auditory perception \u00b6 There are functional and anatomical distinctions between the neural systems involved in the recognition of sounds in the environment and those involved in the sensorimotor guidance of sound production and the spatial processing of sound. Evidence for the separation of these processes has historically come from disparate literatures on the perception and production of speech, music and other sounds. More recent evidence indicates that there are computational distinctions between the rostral and caudal primate auditory cortex that may underlie functional differences in auditory processing. These functional differences may originate from differences in the response times and temporal profiles of neurons in the rostral and caudal auditory cortex, suggesting that computational accounts of primate auditory pathways should focus on the implications of these temporal response differences. A cross-disorder connectome landscape of brain dysconnectivity \u00b6 Many human brain disorders are associated with characteristic alterations in the structural and functional connectivity of the brain. In this article, we explore how commonalities and differences in connectome alterations can reveal relationships across disorders. We survey recent literature on connectivity changes in neurological and psychiatric disorders in the context of key organizational principles of the human connectome and observe that several disturbances to network properties of the human brain have a common role in a wide range of brain disorders and point towards potentially shared network mechanisms underpinning disorders. We hypothesize that the distinct dimensions along which connectome networks are organized (for example, \u2018modularity\u2019 and \u2018integration\u2019) provide a general coordinate system that allows description and categorization of relationships between seemingly disparate disorders. We outline a cross-disorder \u2018connectome landscape of dysconnectivity\u2019 along these principal dimensions of network organization that may place shared connectome alterations between brain disorders in a common framework. \u00b6 img{width: 51%; float: right;}","title":"2019-07"},{"location":"NatRevNeurosci/2019-07/#contents","text":"Research Highlights Preserving perfusion Relaying ageing signals A supporting role Finding your voice Rewarding the cerebellum Fake memories Driving sleep Reviews Roles of axon guidance molecules in neuronal wiring in the developing spinal cord Embracing diversity in the 5-HT neuronal system Perspectives Understanding rostral\u2013caudal auditory cortex contributions to auditory perception A cross-disorder connectome landscape of brain dysconnectivity","title":"Contents"},{"location":"NatRevNeurosci/2019-07/#research_highlights","text":"","title":"Research Highlights"},{"location":"NatRevNeurosci/2019-07/#preserving_perfusion","text":"","title":"Preserving perfusion"},{"location":"NatRevNeurosci/2019-07/#relaying_ageing_signals","text":"","title":"Relaying ageing signals"},{"location":"NatRevNeurosci/2019-07/#a_supporting_role","text":"","title":"A supporting role"},{"location":"NatRevNeurosci/2019-07/#finding_your_voice","text":"","title":"Finding your voice"},{"location":"NatRevNeurosci/2019-07/#rewarding_the_cerebellum","text":"","title":"Rewarding the cerebellum"},{"location":"NatRevNeurosci/2019-07/#fake_memories","text":"","title":"Fake memories"},{"location":"NatRevNeurosci/2019-07/#driving_sleep","text":"","title":"Driving sleep"},{"location":"NatRevNeurosci/2019-07/#reviews","text":"","title":"Reviews"},{"location":"NatRevNeurosci/2019-07/#roles_of_axon_guidance_molecules_in_neuronal_wiring_in_the_developing_spinal_cord","text":"The spinal cord receives, relays and processes sensory information from the periphery and integrates this information with descending inputs from supraspinal centres to elicit precise and appropriate behavioural responses and orchestrate body movements.

We discuss recent data from molecular genetic, genomic and functional methods that, when coupled with classical findings, yield a reframing of the 5-HT neuronal system as a conglomeration of diverse subsystems with potential to inspire novel, more targeted therapies for clinically distinct 5-HT-related disorders.","title":"Embracing diversity in the 5-HT neuronal system"},{"location":"NatRevNeurosci/2019-07/#perspectives","text":"","title":"Perspectives"},{"location":"NatRevNeurosci/2019-07/#understanding_rostralcaudal_auditory_cortex_contributions_to_auditory_perception","text":"There are functional and anatomical distinctions between the neural systems involved in the recognition of sounds in the environment and those involved in the sensorimotor guidance of sound production and the spatial processing of sound. Evidence for the separation of these processes has historically come from disparate literatures on the perception and production of speech, music and other sounds. More recent evidence indicates that there are computational distinctions between the rostral and caudal primate auditory cortex that may underlie functional differences in auditory processing. These functional differences may originate from differences in the response times and temporal profiles of neurons in the rostral and caudal auditory cortex, suggesting that computational accounts of primate auditory pathways should focus on the implications of these temporal response differences.","title":"Understanding rostral\u2013caudal auditory cortex contributions to auditory perception"},{"location":"NatRevNeurosci/2019-07/#a_cross-disorder_connectome_landscape_of_brain_dysconnectivity","text":"Many human brain disorders are associated with characteristic alterations in the structural and functional connectivity of the brain.

We hypothesize that the distinct dimensions along which connectome networks are organized (for example, \u2018modularity\u2019 and \u2018integration\u2019) provide a general coordinate system that allows description and categorization of relationships between seemingly disparate disorders.

Low-dimensional morphospace of topological motifs in human fMRI brain networks Editorial \u00b6 Editorial: New Trends in Connectomics \u00b6 Connectomics is an integral part of network neuroscience. The field has undergone rapid expansion over recent years and increasingly involves a blend of experimental and computational approaches to brain connectivity. This Focus Feature on \u201cNew Trends in Connectomics\u201d aims to track the progress of the field and its many applications across different neurobiological systems and species. comprehensive maps of neural connections principles that underlie network architecture The idea that connections among neural elements are crucial for brain function has been central to modern neuroscience almost since its inception. Building on this idea, the emerging field of connectomics adds several new and important components. First, connectomics provides comprehensive maps of neural connections, with the ultimate goal of achieving complete coverage of any given nervous system. Second, connectomics delivers insights into the principles that underlie network architecture and uncovers how these principles support network function. These dual aims can be accomplished through the confluence of new experimental techniques for mapping connections and new network science methods for modeling and analyzing the resulting large connectivity datasets. Hence, connectomics naturally blends empirical and computational approaches to gain fundamentally new insights into structure and function of brain networks. Connectomics continues to expand rapidly. Since the term \u201cconnectome\u201d was first introduced in 2005 ( Sporns, Tononi, & K\u00f6tter, 2005 ), the number of scientific articles devoted to connectomics has risen continuously (Figure 1). Since networks can be built on many spatial scales and with a variety of experimental techniques, there is a growing need to integrate across these different ways of constructing brain networks and to provide opportunities to exchange insights, data, and models. This need motivated the organization of a recent Keystone Symposium on connectomics with the explicit goal to foster scientific exchange among largely disconnected communities of researchers studying connectomes in different organisms at different scales with different measurement techniques. One central objective was to promote empirical and computational approaches that apply across scales, for example by leveraging the tools of network science ( Bassett & Sporns, 2017 ). In March 2017, approximately 100 connectomics researchers gathered in Santa Fe (New Mexico) to exchange ideas and to discuss the future of the field. All presenters at the workshop were invited to submit their work to Network Neuroscience, to be gathered into a Focus Feature entitled \u201cNew Trends in Connectomics.\u201d Figure 1.\u2003 The growth of connectomics as indexed by the number of published articles and citations. Publication and citation counts were retrieved from Web of Science on March 12, 2018, using the search term \u201cconnectom*\u201d in either topic or title. Through the end of 2017, a total of 2,684 articles were published, accruing a total of 47,725 citations. These counts likely underestimate the impact of connectomics, as many relevant articles do not reference the term \u201cconnectom*\u201d in either topic or title. The result, presented in this new issue of the journal, offers a panoramic overview of an emerging field, with papers that cover a range of techniques applied in different species, and that combine empirical data, modeling, and computation. Mattar, Thompson-Schill, and Bassett (2018) address how functional brain networks change over the course of learning, specifically those connections that link different network communities. Heitmann and Breakspear (2018) address the important role of nonlinear system dynamics in generating fluctuations in functional connectivity, an area of considerable interest in studies of spontaneous or \u201cresting\u201d brain activity. Miranda-Dominguez et al. (2018) use machine-learning techniques to demonstrate the heritability of \u201cconnectotyping\u201d\u2014the identification of individuals based on complex patterns of connectome-wide functional connectivity. Mills et al. (2018) apply functional connectomics to a human disorder (ADHD) and show that behavioral measures are associated with specific changes in the manner in which segregated functional systems interact with one another. Li et al. (2018) apply network science concepts to characterize the functional roles of epileptogenic zones in human electrophysiological data, and suggest that network-based methodologies may have clinical applications. Kesler, Acton, Rao, and Ray (2018) investigate structural and functional connectome network properties in a transgenic mouse model system designed to mimic the pathogenesis of Alzheimer\u2019s disease. Kale, Zalesky, and Gollo (2018) investigate how the directionality of anatomical projections impacts the estimation of commonly used graph-theoretical attributes. Finally, Morgan, Achard, Termenon, Bullmore, and V\u00e9rtes (2018) decompose functional brain networks into network motifs and use variations in motif frequency and composition to probe for generative processes underlying network formation. Much discussion at the Keystone Symposium revolved around the issues that will occupy connectomics in the years to come. Clearly, continued improvements in measurement accuracy and coverage will give us improved connectivity maps, in a wider range of organisms and at various scales of resolution. With these developments will come an increasing need to design more advanced computational tools and theoretical frameworks to enable deeper insight into the fundamental principles of brain network architecture and function. And as maps and tools improve, the study of brain networks will continue to evolve, moving beyond descriptive accounts to models that incorporate a rich set of neurobiological mechanisms, address changes in network structure and dynamics, reveal the network basis of cognition and behavior, and enable targeted intervention, prediction, and control. Network Neuroscience will continue to serve as a prime forum for dissemination and discussion in this important field for many years to come. Focus Feature: New Trends in Connectomics \u00b6 The network architecture of value learning \u00b6 Putting the \u201cdynamic\u201d back into dynamic functional connectivity \u00b6 The study of fluctuations in time-resolved functional connectivity is a topic of substantial current interest. As the term \u201c dynamic functional connectivity \u201d implies, such fluctuations are believed to arise from dynamics in the neuronal systems generating these signals. While considerable activity currently attends to methodological and statistical issues regarding dynamic functional connectivity, less attention has been paid toward its candidate causes . Here, we review candidate scenarios for dynamic (functional) connectivity that arise in dynamical systems with two or more subsystems; generalized synchronization, itinerancy (a form of metastability), and multistability. Each of these scenarios arises under different configurations of local dynamics and intersystem coupling: We show how they generate time series data with nonlinear and/or nonstationary multivariate statistics. The key issue is that time series generated by coupled nonlinear systems contain a richer temporal structure than matched multivariate (linear) stochastic processes. In turn, this temporal structure yields many of the phenomena proposed as important to large-scale communication and computation in the brain, such as phase-amplitude coupling, complexity, and flexibility. The code for simulating these dynamics is available in a freeware software platform, the Brain Dynamics Toolbox . Heritability of the human connectome: A connectotyping study \u00b6 ADHD and attentional control: Impaired segregation of task positive and task negative brain networks \u00b6 Using network analysis to localize the epileptogenic zone from invasive EEG recordings in intractable focal epilepsy \u00b6 Functional and structural connectome properties in the 5XFAD transgenic mouse model of Alzheimer\u2019s disease \u00b6 Estimating the impact of structural directionality: How reliable are undirected connectomes? \u00b6 Directionality is a fundamental feature of network connections. Most structural brain networks are intrinsically directed because of the nature of chemical synapses, which comprise most neuronal connections. Because of the limitations of noninvasive imaging techniques, the directionality of connections between structurally connected regions of the human brain cannot be confirmed. Hence, connections are represented as undirected, and it is still unknown how this lack of directionality affects brain network topology. Using six directed brain networks from different species and parcellations (cat, mouse, C. elegans, and three macaque networks), we estimate the inaccuracies in network measures (degree, betweenness, clustering coefficient, path length, global efficiency, participation index, and small-worldness) associated with the removal of the directionality of connections. We employ three different methods to render directed brain networks undirected: (a) remove unidirectional connections, (b) add reciprocal connections, and (c) combine equal numbers of removed and added unidirectional connections. We quantify the extent of inaccuracy in network measures introduced through neglecting connection directionality for individual nodes and across the network. We find that the coarse division between core and peripheral nodes remains accurate for undirected networks. However, hub nodes differ considerably when directionality is neglected. Comparing the different methods to generate undirected networks from directed ones, we generally find that the addition of reciprocal connections (false positives) causes larger errors in graph-theoretic measures than the removal of the same number of directed connections (false negatives). These findings suggest that directionality plays an essential role in shaping brain networks and highlight some limitations of undirected connectomes.

Here, we explored an alternative deep neural network, variational auto-encoder ([VAE]) , as a computational model of the visual cortex. We trained a VAE with a five-layer encoder and a five-layer decoder to learn visual representations from a diverse set of unlabeled images. Using the trained VAE, we predicted and decoded cortical activity observed with functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) from three human subjects passively watching natural videos. Compared to CNN, VAE could predict the video-evoked cortical responses with comparable accuracy in early visual areas, but relatively lower accuracy in higher-order visual areas. The distinction between CNN and VAE in terms of encoding performance was primarily attributed to their different learning objectives, rather than their different model architecture or number of parameters. Despite lower encoding accuracies, VAE offered a more convenient strategy for decoding the fMRI activity to reconstruct the video input, by first converting the fMRI activity to the VAE's latent variables, and then converting the latent variables to the reconstructed video frames through the VAE's decoder. This strategy was more advantageous than alternative decoding methods, e.g. partial least squares regression, for being able to reconstruct both the spatial structure and color of the visual input. Such findings highlight VAE as an unsupervised model for learning visual representation, as well as its potential and limitations for explaining cortical responses and reconstructing naturalistic and diverse visual experiences.
