The patients showed normal electroretinography responses, no signs of albinism, and no anterior segment or brain abnormalities. Upon whole exome sequencing, we identified a homozygous mutation (c.1861C>T;p.Q621*) in the aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AHR) gene that perfectly co-segregated with the disease in the larger family. AHR is a ligand-activated transcription factor that has been intensively studied in xenobiotic-induced toxicity. Further, it has been shown to play a physiological role under normal cellular conditions, such as in immunity, inflammatory response and neurogenesis. Notably, knockout of the Ahr gene in mouse impairs optic nerve myelin sheath formation and results in oculomotor deficits sharing many features with our patients: the eye movement disorder in Ahr\u2212/\u2212 mice appears early in development and presents as conjugate horizontal pendular nystagmus. We therefore propose AHR to be a novel disease gene for a new, recessively inherited disorder in humans, characterized by infantile nystagmus and foveal hypoplasia. Loss of STEP61 couples disinhibition to N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor potentiation in rodent and human spinal pain processing \u00b6 Dysregulated excitability within the spinal dorsal horn is a critical mediator of chronic pain. In the rodent nerve injury model of neuropathic pain, BDNF-mediated loss of inhibition (disinhibition) gates the potentiation of excitatory GluN2B N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor (NMDAR) responses at lamina I dorsal horn synapses. However, the centrality of this mechanism across pain states and species, as well as the molecular linker involved, remain unknown. Here, we show that KCC2-dependent disinhibition is coupled to increased GluN2B-mediated synaptic NMDAR responses in a rodent model of inflammatory pain, with an associated downregulation of the tyrosine phosphatase STEP61. The decreased activity of STEP61 is both necessary and sufficient to prime subsequent phosphorylation and potentiation of GluN2B NMDAR by BDNF at lamina I synapses. Blocking disinhibition reversed the downregulation of STEP61 as well as inflammation-mediated behavioural hypersensitivity. For the first time, we characterize GluN2B-mediated NMDAR responses at human lamina I synapses and show that a human ex vivo BDNF model of pathological pain processing downregulates KCC2 and STEP61 and upregulates phosphorylated GluN2B at dorsal horn synapses. Our results demonstrate that STEP61 is the molecular brake that is lost following KCC2-dependent disinhibition and that the decrease in STEP61 activity drives the potentiation of excitatory GluN2B NMDAR responses in rodent and human models of pathological pain. The ex vivo human BDNF model may thus form a translational bridge between rodents and humans for identification and validation of novel molecular pain targets.

Low-dimensional morphospace of topological motifs in human fMRI brain networks Editorial \u00b6 Editorial: New Trends in Connectomics \u00b6 Connectomics is an integral part of network neuroscience. The field has undergone rapid expansion over recent years and increasingly involves a blend of experimental and computational approaches to brain connectivity. This Focus Feature on \u201cNew Trends in Connectomics\u201d aims to track the progress of the field and its many applications across different neurobiological systems and species. comprehensive maps of neural connections principles that underlie network architecture The idea that connections among neural elements are crucial for brain function has been central to modern neuroscience almost since its inception. Building on this idea, the emerging field of connectomics adds several new and important components. First, connectomics provides comprehensive maps of neural connections, with the ultimate goal of achieving complete coverage of any given nervous system. Second, connectomics delivers insights into the principles that underlie network architecture and uncovers how these principles support network function. These dual aims can be accomplished through the confluence of new experimental techniques for mapping connections and new network science methods for modeling and analyzing the resulting large connectivity datasets. Hence, connectomics naturally blends empirical and computational approaches to gain fundamentally new insights into structure and function of brain networks. Connectomics continues to expand rapidly. Since the term \u201cconnectome\u201d was first introduced in 2005 ( Sporns, Tononi, & K\u00f6tter, 2005 ), the number of scientific articles devoted to connectomics has risen continuously (Figure 1). Since networks can be built on many spatial scales and with a variety of experimental techniques, there is a growing need to integrate across these different ways of constructing brain networks and to provide opportunities to exchange insights, data, and models. This need motivated the organization of a recent Keystone Symposium on connectomics with the explicit goal to foster scientific exchange among largely disconnected communities of researchers studying connectomes in different organisms at different scales with different measurement techniques. One central objective was to promote empirical and computational approaches that apply across scales, for example by leveraging the tools of network science ( Bassett & Sporns, 2017 ). In March 2017, approximately 100 connectomics researchers gathered in Santa Fe (New Mexico) to exchange ideas and to discuss the future of the field. All presenters at the workshop were invited to submit their work to Network Neuroscience, to be gathered into a Focus Feature entitled \u201cNew Trends in Connectomics.\u201d Figure 1.\u2003 The growth of connectomics as indexed by the number of published articles and citations. Publication and citation counts were retrieved from Web of Science on March 12, 2018, using the search term \u201cconnectom*\u201d in either topic or title. Through the end of 2017, a total of 2,684 articles were published, accruing a total of 47,725 citations. These counts likely underestimate the impact of connectomics, as many relevant articles do not reference the term \u201cconnectom*\u201d in either topic or title. The result, presented in this new issue of the journal, offers a panoramic overview of an emerging field, with papers that cover a range of techniques applied in different species, and that combine empirical data, modeling, and computation. Mattar, Thompson-Schill, and Bassett (2018) address how functional brain networks change over the course of learning, specifically those connections that link different network communities. Heitmann and Breakspear (2018) address the important role of nonlinear system dynamics in generating fluctuations in functional connectivity, an area of considerable interest in studies of spontaneous or \u201cresting\u201d brain activity. Miranda-Dominguez et al. (2018) use machine-learning techniques to demonstrate the heritability of \u201cconnectotyping\u201d\u2014the identification of individuals based on complex patterns of connectome-wide functional connectivity. Mills et al. (2018) apply functional connectomics to a human disorder (ADHD) and show that behavioral measures are associated with specific changes in the manner in which segregated functional systems interact with one another. Li et al. (2018) apply network science concepts to characterize the functional roles of epileptogenic zones in human electrophysiological data, and suggest that network-based methodologies may have clinical applications. Kesler, Acton, Rao, and Ray (2018) investigate structural and functional connectome network properties in a transgenic mouse model system designed to mimic the pathogenesis of Alzheimer\u2019s disease. Kale, Zalesky, and Gollo (2018) investigate how the directionality of anatomical projections impacts the estimation of commonly used graph-theoretical attributes. Finally, Morgan, Achard, Termenon, Bullmore, and V\u00e9rtes (2018) decompose functional brain networks into network motifs and use variations in motif frequency and composition to probe for generative processes underlying network formation. Much discussion at the Keystone Symposium revolved around the issues that will occupy connectomics in the years to come. Clearly, continued improvements in measurement accuracy and coverage will give us improved connectivity maps, in a wider range of organisms and at various scales of resolution. With these developments will come an increasing need to design more advanced computational tools and theoretical frameworks to enable deeper insight into the fundamental principles of brain network architecture and function. And as maps and tools improve, the study of brain networks will continue to evolve, moving beyond descriptive accounts to models that incorporate a rich set of neurobiological mechanisms, address changes in network structure and dynamics, reveal the network basis of cognition and behavior, and enable targeted intervention, prediction, and control. Network Neuroscience will continue to serve as a prime forum for dissemination and discussion in this important field for many years to come. Focus Feature: New Trends in Connectomics \u00b6 The network architecture of value learning \u00b6 Putting the \u201cdynamic\u201d back into dynamic functional connectivity \u00b6 The study of fluctuations in time-resolved functional connectivity is a topic of substantial current interest. As the term \u201c dynamic functional connectivity \u201d implies, such fluctuations are believed to arise from dynamics in the neuronal systems generating these signals. While considerable activity currently attends to methodological and statistical issues regarding dynamic functional connectivity, less attention has been paid toward its candidate causes . Here, we review candidate scenarios for dynamic (functional) connectivity that arise in dynamical systems with two or more subsystems; generalized synchronization, itinerancy (a form of metastability), and multistability. Each of these scenarios arises under different configurations of local dynamics and intersystem coupling: We show how they generate time series data with nonlinear and/or nonstationary multivariate statistics. The key issue is that time series generated by coupled nonlinear systems contain a richer temporal structure than matched multivariate (linear) stochastic processes. In turn, this temporal structure yields many of the phenomena proposed as important to large-scale communication and computation in the brain, such as phase-amplitude coupling, complexity, and flexibility. The code for simulating these dynamics is available in a freeware software platform, the Brain Dynamics Toolbox . Heritability of the human connectome: A connectotyping study \u00b6 ADHD and attentional control: Impaired segregation of task positive and task negative brain networks \u00b6 Using network analysis to localize the epileptogenic zone from invasive EEG recordings in intractable focal epilepsy \u00b6 Functional and structural connectome properties in the 5XFAD transgenic mouse model of Alzheimer\u2019s disease \u00b6 Estimating the impact of structural directionality: How reliable are undirected connectomes? \u00b6 Directionality is a fundamental feature of network connections. Most structural brain networks are intrinsically directed because of the nature of chemical synapses, which comprise most neuronal connections. Because of the limitations of noninvasive imaging techniques, the directionality of connections between structurally connected regions of the human brain cannot be confirmed. Hence, connections are represented as undirected, and it is still unknown how this lack of directionality affects brain network topology. Using six directed brain networks from different species and parcellations (cat, mouse, C. elegans, and three macaque networks), we estimate the inaccuracies in network measures (degree, betweenness, clustering coefficient, path length, global efficiency, participation index, and small-worldness) associated with the removal of the directionality of connections. We employ three different methods to render directed brain networks undirected: (a) remove unidirectional connections, (b) add reciprocal connections, and (c) combine equal numbers of removed and added unidirectional connections. We quantify the extent of inaccuracy in network measures introduced through neglecting connection directionality for individual nodes and across the network. We find that the coarse division between core and peripheral nodes remains accurate for undirected networks. However, hub nodes differ considerably when directionality is neglected. Comparing the different methods to generate undirected networks from directed ones, we generally find that the addition of reciprocal connections (false positives) causes larger errors in graph-theoretic measures than the removal of the same number of directed connections (false negatives). These findings suggest that directionality plays an essential role in shaping brain networks and highlight some limitations of undirected connectomes.

Network Neuroscience will continue to serve as a prime forum for dissemination and discussion in this important field for many years to come.","title":"Editorial: New Trends in Connectomics"},{"location":"NetwNeurosci/2018-no2/#focus_feature_new_trends_in_connectomics","text":"","title":"Focus Feature: New Trends in Connectomics"},{"location":"NetwNeurosci/2018-no2/#the_network_architecture_of_value_learning","text":"","title":"The network architecture of value learning"},{"location":"NetwNeurosci/2018-no2/#putting_the_dynamic_back_into_dynamic_functional_connectivity","text":"The study of fluctuations in time-resolved functional connectivity is a topic of substantial current interest. As the term \u201c dynamic functional connectivity \u201d implies, such fluctuations are believed to arise from dynamics in the neuronal systems generating these signals. While considerable activity currently attends to methodological and statistical issues regarding dynamic functional connectivity, less attention has been paid toward its candidate causes . Here, we review candidate scenarios for dynamic (functional) connectivity that arise in dynamical systems with two or more subsystems; generalized synchronization, itinerancy (a form of metastability), and multistability. Each of these scenarios arises under different configurations of local dynamics and intersystem coupling: We show how they generate time series data with nonlinear and/or nonstationary multivariate statistics. The key issue is that time series generated by coupled nonlinear systems contain a richer temporal structure than matched multivariate (linear) stochastic processes. In turn, this temporal structure yields many of the phenomena proposed as important to large-scale communication and computation in the brain, such as phase-amplitude coupling, complexity, and flexibility. The code for simulating these dynamics is available in a freeware software platform, the Brain Dynamics Toolbox .","title":"Putting the \u201cdynamic\u201d back into dynamic functional connectivity"},{"location":"NetwNeurosci/2018-no2/#heritability_of_the_human_connectome_a_connectotyping_study","text":"","title":"Heritability of the human connectome: A connectotyping study"},{"location":"NetwNeurosci/2018-no2/#adhd_and_attentional_control_impaired_segregation_of_task_positive_and_task_negative_brain_networks","text":"","title":"ADHD and attentional control: Impaired segregation of task positive and task negative brain networks"},{"location":"NetwNeurosci/2018-no2/#using_network_analysis_to_localize_the_epileptogenic_zone_from_invasive_eeg_recordings_in_intractable_focal_epilepsy","text":"","title":"Using network analysis to localize the epileptogenic zone from invasive EEG recordings in intractable focal epilepsy"},{"location":"NetwNeurosci/2018-no2/#functional_and_structural_connectome_properties_in_the_5xfad_transgenic_mouse_model_of_alzheimers_disease","text":"","title":"Functional and structural connectome properties in the 5XFAD transgenic mouse model of Alzheimer\u2019s disease"},{"location":"NetwNeurosci/2018-no2/#estimating_the_impact_of_structural_directionality_how_reliable_are_undirected_connectomes","text":"Directionality is a fundamental feature of network connections. Most structural brain networks are intrinsically directed because of the nature of chemical synapses, which comprise most neuronal connections. Because of the limitations of noninvasive imaging techniques, the directionality of connections between structurally connected regions of the human brain cannot be confirmed. Hence, connections are represented as undirected, and it is still unknown how this lack of directionality affects brain network topology. Using six directed brain networks from different species and parcellations (cat, mouse, C. elegans, and three macaque networks), we estimate the inaccuracies in network measures (degree, betweenness, clustering coefficient, path length, global efficiency, participation index, and small-worldness) associated with the removal of the directionality of connections. We employ three different methods to render directed brain networks undirected: (a) remove unidirectional connections, (b) add reciprocal connections, and (c) combine equal numbers of removed and added unidirectional connections. We quantify the extent of inaccuracy in network measures introduced through neglecting connection directionality for individual nodes and across the network. We find that the coarse division between core and peripheral nodes remains accurate for undirected networks. However, hub nodes differ considerably when directionality is neglected. Comparing the different methods to generate undirected networks from directed ones, we generally find that the addition of reciprocal connections (false positives) causes larger errors in graph-theoretic measures than the removal of the same number of directed connections (false negatives). These findings suggest that directionality plays an essential role in shaping brain networks and highlight some limitations of undirected connectomes.","title":"Estimating the impact of structural directionality: How reliable are undirected connectomes?"},{"location":"NetwNeurosci/2018-no2/#low-dimensional_morphospace_of_topological_motifs_in_human_fmri_brain_networks","text":"","title":"Low-dimensional morphospace of topological motifs in human fMRI brain networks"},{"location":"NetwNeurosci/2019-no2/","text":"Network Neuroscience: 2019 No.2 \u00b6 Contents \u00b6 Review Disentangling causal webs in the brain using functional magnetic resonance imaging: A review of current approaches Methods Research Review \u00b6 Disentangling causal webs in the brain using functional magnetic resonance imaging: A review of current approaches \u00b6 In the past two decades, functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) has been used to relate neuronal network activity to cognitive processing and behavior.
